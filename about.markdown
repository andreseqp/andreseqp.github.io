title: About me
---

I am an evolutionary biologist interested in combining experimental and 
theoretical approaches to understand social systems. I develop mathematical 
and computational models of the evolution of social behaviours, and I have 
done field experiments to discover the mechanisms behind these social behaviours. 
At the moment, I am a posdoctoral researcher at the behavioural ecology group 
in the University of Neuch√¢tel, Switzerland. My current project is about 
developing computational models of the learning processes inspired by cleaner 
fish, if you want to know more about this click here. During my PhD in 
Groningen the Netherlands, I worked on a variety of topics revolving around 
the evolution of social behaviour, among them: cultural evolution, the 
evolution of eusociality and the evolution of cooperative breeding. 
If you want to know more about it, you can go to here, where you can also 
download my thesis, or go to my publications page. I am still a novice 
photographer, but I like taking pictures very much. If you want, the take 
a look at some of my pics below. Partly due to my Colombian background I 
have strong opinions about drugs and drug policy. I tried to explain some of 
those opinions in a essay, if you are interested and can understand Spanish 
ask me for a copy.
