<p>I am an evolutionary biologist interested in combining experimental and 
theoretical approaches to understand social systems. I develop mathematical 
and computational models of the evolution of social behaviours, and I have 
done field experiments to discover the mechanisms behind these social behaviours.
At the moment, I am a posdoctoral researcher at the behavioural ecology 
group in the University of Neuchâtel, Switzerland. My current project is 
about developing computational models of the learning processes inspired by 
cleaner fish, if you want to know more about this click here. During my PhD 
in Groninge the Netherlands, I worked on a variety of topics revolving around 
the evolution of social behaviour, among them: cultural evolution, the 
evolution of eusociality and the evolution of cooperative breeding. 
If you want to know more about it, you can go to here, where you can 
also download my thesis, or go to my publications page.
I am still a novice photographer, but I like taking pictures very much. 
If you want, the take a look at some of my pics below.
Partly due to my Colombian background I have strong opinions about drugs and 
drug policy. I tried to explain some of those opinions in a essay, if you are 
interested and can understand Spanish ask me for a copy.</p>
